    "Now that the dataset is loaded in memory, it is time to use EFlowCalc to calculate the streamflow characteristics from the hydrograph(s). To do so, import `eflowcalc`, which will give you access to the `calculator` Python function as well as all streamflow characteristics implemented in EFlowCalc (as Python functions as well). To calculate any characteristic from your streamflow timeseries, you only need to call the calculator function and provide four positional arguments: the Python function (or an iterable containing several functions) corresponding to the characteristic(s) to be calculated (e.g. `ma41`, `dh4`, `(ma41, dh4)`, etc.), the DateTime numpy array that represents the period the flows are provided for (it can only contain one timeseries), the numpy array containing the streamflow timeseries (it can be multiple timeseries), and finally the catchment drainage area in square kilometers.

Moreover, all streamflow characteristics are only computed on full hydrological years (it will automatically trim the head and tail of the timeseries to guarantee so). By default, a hydrological year starts on the 1st of October, which is commonly the case in the Northern hemisphere. However, it can be changed to suit any location using the keyword argument `hydro_year`. For example, if working on a catchment in the Southern hemisphere, it is likely that the hydrological year starts on the 1st of July:"

    "EFlowCalc can only deal with 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional numpy arrays as input. EFlowCalc can evaluate multiple simulated timeseries at the same time (using vectorised calculations). This means that the streamflow timeseries can be a 2-dimensional array with both dimensions of size greater than 1, one of them being the time dimension and must match the length of the DateTime series. By default, EFlowCalc is expecting the time dimension to be on the second axis (i.e. `axis=1`) if a 2-dimensional array is provided (applicable to both the streamflow and datetime series). If this is not the case with your dataset, you need to redefine the `axis` keyword argument default value and set it to `0` (for the first axis). Alternatively, you can transpose your arrays before giving them to EFlowCalc."
