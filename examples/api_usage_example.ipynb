To do so, import `eflowcalc`, which will give you access to the `calculator` Python function as well as all stream flow characteristics implemented in EFlowCalc (as Python functions as well).

Moreover, all stream flow characteristics are only computed on full hydrological years (it will automatically trim the head and tail of the time series to guarantee so). By default, a hydrological year starts on the 1st of October, which is commonly the case in the Northern hemisphere. However, it can be changed to suit any location using the keyword argument `hydro_year`. For example, if working on a catchment in the Southern hemisphere, it is likely that the hydrological year starts on the 1st of July:"

    "EFlowCalc can only deal with 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional numpy arrays as input. EFlowCalc can evaluate multiple simulated timeseries at the same time (using vectorised calculations). This means that the stream flow numpy array can be 2-dimensional, one of them being the time dimension and must match the length of the DateTime numpy array length. By default, EFlowCalc is expecting the time dimension to be on the first axis (i.e. `axis=0`) if a 2-dimensional array is provided (applicable to both the stream flow and datetime arrays). If this is not the case with your data set, you need to redefine the `axis` keyword argument default value and set it to `1` (for the second axis). Alternatively, you can transpose your arrays before giving them to EFlowCalc."
