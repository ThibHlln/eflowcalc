# EFlowCalc - An efficient calculator of ecological streamflow characteristics in Python

`eflowcalc` is an open-source `calculator` of streamflow characteristics
in Python. It is licensed under GNU GPL-3.0 (see licence file provided).
The package currently gives the Python scientific community access
to 159 ecologically relevant streamflow characteristics inventoried by 
[Olden and Poff (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.700). A key strength 
of `eflowcalc` is the vectorisation of all calculations (using 
[numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), and therefore C code in the
background) which makes for very efficient computation of the streamflow
characteristics. 

Please refer to the [online documentation](https://thibhlln.github.io/eflowcalc) 
for further details and learn how to use the package.
